## Overview

Welcome to the **Analyzing Covid Deaths and Vaccination Impact** project! This project aims to explore and analyze the correlation between Covid deaths and the impact of vaccination. The main focus is on understanding the trends, patterns, and insights derived from the available data.

## Project Structure

I plan on separating the project into different components:

1. Data Collection: Data source([owid](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths))
2. Data Cleaning with Python
3. Data Exploration with Databricks Apache Spark SQL
4. Data Visualization with Tableau

## Future Work

The project doesn't stop here! I want to explore other metrics that matter to the correlation of death, vaccination, and infection rate, including: 
- Country budget for healthcare
- Country GDP
- Country happiness level

## Some Interesting Insights!!!

I found out that Latvia has the highest percentage of population infected! I will dig deeper into finding the reason and creating some insights of this result.
